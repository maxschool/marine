		kingdom: 'Animalia',
		species: 'Sepia Officinalis (Cuddlefish)',
		classification: 'Cuttlefish are carnivorous molluscs, with tentacles and "beaks". They live in any condition of salt water, deep or shallow ocean. Thus, their diet is mostly comprised of fish.',
		theme: 'When water passes through their gills, it goes into their bodies, and the salt is put into the system. However, as to maintain a stable amount of water within the Cuttlefish at a given time, it will urinate out the water, along with the intaken salt. ',

		kingdom: 'Fungi',
		species: 'Wallemia ichthyophaga',
		classification: 'Wallemia ichthyophaga is a multicellular fungi, and is even considered a halophile due to its high salt tolerance.',
		theme: 'In order to tolerate high concentrations of salt, the cell wall of the Wallemia ichthyophaga will thicken almost three times over and up to four times more cells are spawned. This ensures the survival of the organism when the salt concentration proves to be a threat, and reduces risk of the cells breaching.',

		kingdom: 'Archaea',
		species: 'Halobacterium cutirubrum',
		classification: 'They are considered archaebacteria due to the fact that they thrive in extreme environments. They use chemosynthesis for food.',
		theme: 'Halobacterium thrive in places of extreme salt due to their halotolerance, or adaptation to salt outside the membrane. They produce solutes (chemicals in a solution) to aid in neutralizing the saline content in the environment with the saline content within their cells.',

		kingdom: 'Protista',
		species: 'Caulerpa Racemosa (Sea grapes)',
		classification: 'Sea grapes are a type of green algae, living on coral and other reefs. They can live as far down into the ocean as 100m. To reproduce, their stalks fall off and float away, a behavior unique to organisms that live in the water. Sea grapes can come in different shapes and stalk patterns, reflecting how diverse a habitat they can reside in. These differences show how different parts of the ocean can affect how their organisms adapt.',
		theme: 'Protists utilize a Contractile Vacuole, an organelle which assists in the circulation of water within the cell. This contributes to its overall homeostasis regulating salt water intake because the organelle allows easy control of the liquid.',

		classification: 'The Trichodesmium is a Cyanobacteria that is responsible for a large amount of nitrogen fixation in the ocean. Iron is required for this process to occur, so iron dust blown from other parts of the world will cause blooms of Trichodesmium to thrive.',
		theme: 'The output of the nitrogen fixation for the organism is contingent on the salt content of the environment. Thus, more instances of the organism will grow where salinity content is higher than usual.',

		species: 'Posidonia angustifolia (Seagrass)',
		classification: 'Seagrass is a plant which sprouts from the ocean floor. It is flowering, yet can sometimes grow fully submerged.',
		theme: "Seagrass's osmoregulation (the control of high salinity water) includes release of ions and osmolites, and may be correlated with excreting excess salt. A higher amount of salt may not allow plants to survive if they do not have sufficient osmoregulation capabilities.",
